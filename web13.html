     <h1>The Night Manager</h1>
     <p><em>Shantanu 'Shaan' Sengupta, a former Lieutenant in the Indian Navy, is currently working as a night manager in a premiere star hotel in Dhaka, amidst the Rohingya genocide in 2017. He is approached by Safina Kidwai, wife of the majority share owner of the star hotel, Freddie Rehman, to help her escape to India. Upon his refusal, she steals his phone and discreetly records a meeting in Shaan's phone between Shaildendra 'Shelly' Rungta and her Freddy, about buying and smuggling illegal arms into Bangladesh. She also takes pictures of the paperwork and returns the phone to Shaan, so that he can view everything. Upon seeing everything, he goes to his friend, Vikram Bhagwat, of the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, to share the information and evidence.

Vikram, in-turn, sends the information to RAW officer, Lipika Saikia Rao, who is the in-charge of Bangladesh, in New Delhi. She has been keeping tabs on Shelly and believes that the evidence she received from Safina and Shaan is enough to officially go after him. She requests Shaan to keep Safina safe for a night, till she arrives in Dhaka the next afternoon. Meanwhile, both Freddie and Shelly come to know about their meeting being leaked; Shelly asks Freddie to kill Safina. He, along with his men, search the entire hotel for her. Shaan takes Safina to a new wing that is currently under construction in the star hotel, for safekeeping. The next day, as he goes out to get food for Safina, he calls Lipika to inquire about her current whereabouts, however, Lipika realizes that her phone has been bugged and orders Shaan to hurry back to Safina. He comes back just as Safina falls to her death from the wing. Her death is ruled as a suicide by the local police, who say that she stole jewelry from the high-profile guests in the hotel and jumped as she was caught. This devastates both Shaan and Lipika, knowing completely well that both Freddie and Shelly were behind her death. This prompts Shaan to leave his job.</em></p>
