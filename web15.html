     <h1>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h1>
     <p><em> Everything Everywhere All at Once is a 2022 American absurdist comedy-drama film written, directed, and co-produced by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (collectively known as "Daniels"). The plot centers on Evelyn Wang, a Chinese-American immigrant who, while being audited by the IRS, discovers that she must connect with parallel universe versions of herself to prevent a powerful being from destroying the multiverse. The film stars Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn, with Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., James Hong, and Jamie Lee Curtis in supporting roles. The New York Times called the film a "swirl of genre anarchy" with elements of surreal comedy, science fiction, fantasy, martial arts films, and animation.[6].</em></p>
