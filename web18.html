     <h1>Evil Dead || </h1>
     <p><em> Evil Dead II (also known in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn)[6] is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Sam Raimi, who co-wrote it with Scott Spiegel. The film is the second installment in the Evil Dead film series and is considered both a remake and sequel (or "re-quel")[7] to The Evil Dead (1981).[8][9][10] It stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, who vacations with his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods. He discovers an audio tape of recitations from a book of ancient texts, and when the recording is played, it unleashes a number of demons which possess and torment him.

After the critical and commercial failure of Crimewave (1985), Raimi, producer Robert Tapert, and Campbell began work on a sequel to The Evil Dead at the insistence of their publicist Irvin Shapiro. Having endorsed the original film, author Stephen King brought the project to the attention of producer Dino De Laurentiis, with whom he had been making his directorial debut Maximum Overdrive (1986). De Laurentiis agreed to provide financial backing, and assigned the filmmakers a considerably larger budget than they had worked with on the original film. Although Raimi had devised a premise set in the Middle Ages and involving time travel, De Laurentiis requested that the film be similar to its predecessor..</em></p>
